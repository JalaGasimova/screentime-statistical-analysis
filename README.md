📊 Screen Time Analysis

This project performs a comprehensive statistical analysis of a screen time dataset using Python, exploring patterns in digital habits and their relationship with productivity.


🧠 Project Overview

The analysis follows four main stages:

1. Descriptive Analysis

Examined basic statistics for each age group

Calculated average screen time by age

Analyzed average productivity by gender

2. Distribution Analysis

Visualized average screen time distribution with histograms

Identified outliers using boxplots

3. Correlation Analysis

Measured correlation between average screen time and productivity

Created scatter plots and overall correlation matrices

4. Statistical Tests

Checked normality using Shapiro-Wilk test

Applied Spearman correlation

Conducted independent t-tests by gender

Performed ANOVA for age group comparisons


🧰 Technologies Used

Python: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, SciPy

Jupyter Notebook for interactive analysis


📈 Key Outcomes

Insight into screen time patterns across age and gender

Relationships between screen time and productivity

Statistical validation of observed differences
